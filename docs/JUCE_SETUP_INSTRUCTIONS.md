# JUCE 8 Setup Instructions for OTTO

## üö® License Compliance Notice

OTTO is licensed under GPL v3, which allows us to use JUCE 8 under its AGPLv3 license. However, **we cannot redistribute JUCE's source code** with our project. You must download JUCE 8 yourself.

## Required JUCE Version

- **JUCE 8.0.0 or later**
- Download from: https://juce.com/get-juce

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download JUCE 8
1. Visit https://juce.com/get-juce
2. Create a free account (if needed)
3. Download JUCE 8.0.0 or later
4. Extract the downloaded archive

### 2. Place JUCE in Your OTTO Directory
```bash
# Assuming you downloaded JUCE to ~/Downloads/JUCE-8.x.x/
cd /path/to/your/OTTO/project
cp -r ~/Downloads/JUCE-8.x.x/ ./JUCE/
```

### 3. Verify Installation
After copying JUCE, your directory structure should look like:
```
OTTO/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JUCE/                    # ‚Üê JUCE framework (you downloaded this)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modules/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extras/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JuceLibraryCode/         # ‚Üê Generated by ProJucer (git ignored)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Source/                  # ‚Üê OTTO source code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OTTO.jucer
```

### 4. Build OTTO
```bash
# Use our provided build script
./scripts/development/build_macos.sh
```

## Important Notes

### What's Tracked in Git
‚úÖ **Tracked (in repository):**
- OTTO source code (`Source/`)
- ProJucer project files (`*.jucer`)
- Build scripts (`scripts/`)
- CMake configuration (`CMakeLists.txt`, `cmake/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`)

‚ùå **NOT Tracked (git ignored):**
- `JUCE/` folder (you download this)
- `JuceLibraryCode/` folder (generated by ProJucer)
- Build artifacts (`build*/`, `*_artefacts/`)

### Why This Approach?

1. **License Compliance**: JUCE's AGPLv3 license allows open source use but requires users to obtain JUCE themselves
2. **Repository Size**: Keeps our repository small and focused on OTTO-specific code
3. **Version Control**: Ensures everyone uses the correct JUCE version we tested with

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "JUCE modules not found"**
- Solution: Ensure JUCE folder is in the project root, not a subfolder

**Problem: "ProJucer can't find JUCE"**
- Solution: In ProJucer, set "JUCE Module Path" to `./JUCE/modules`

**Problem: Build fails with JUCE errors**
- Solution: Verify you have JUCE 8.0.0 or later (not JUCE 7.x or earlier)

## Legal Compliance

By using JUCE 8 with OTTO:
- OTTO (GPL v3) + JUCE (AGPLv3) = Fully compliant open source distribution
- Both licenses require source code availability (which we provide)
- No commercial licensing fees required for open source projects
